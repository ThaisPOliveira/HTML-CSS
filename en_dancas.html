        <h3 class="titulo" id="yellow">Spanish Dance</h3><br><br><br>
        <p>Spanish dance has very peculiar characteristics: it resembles in some aspects the Portuguese dances and, at the same time, presents similar traits to some Latin American dance types.<br><br>Marked by elegant and sensual movements, Spanish dance brings cultural elements from the Iberian country, demonstrating to its spectators its rich historical heritage. Like Portugal, Spain has exported its typical dances all over the world, especially to its former colonies.</p><br><br>

        <h1> Origin of Spanish Dances </h1><br><br>
        <p>The first records of the development of Spanish dance as we know it today date back to the 15th century. In the beginning, they were practiced only by a more privileged part of Catalonia, composed of dancers of bourgeois origin.<br><br>From the 18th century, when the types of dances in Spain already had their own recognized characteristics, the more humble castes of the population began to take an interest in the subject.<br><br>But it was thanks to the gypsies living in Spain that Spanish dancing really took off worldwide, for they are credited with creating the country's most famous type of dance: flamenco.<br><br>It's inevitable: whoever thinks of Spanish dance, immediately thinks of flamenco. But those who think that the dance of the Iberian country is simply limited to this style are mistaken. Below, we present some examples of typical Spanish dances.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Flamenco</h1><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_flamengo.jpg"><br><br>
        <p>With Arab, Jewish, and Gypsy influences, flamenco is present in the identity of the Andalusian people and is considered an icon of Spanish culture.<br>We can cite the following artists as great names in flamenco music:</p><br><br>
        <h2>Paco de Lucía (1947-2014)</h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_pacodelucia.jfif" alt="Paco de Lucía"><br><br>
        <p>Paco de Lucía, whose given name was Francisco Sánchez Gómez, was born on December 21, 1947 in the Andalusian city of Cádiz.<br>He became a world-renowned musician, who had the merit, together with Camarón de la Isla, to modernize and popularize traditional flamenco music worldwide, combining it with jazz and other genres such as Brazilian bossa-nova and classical music.</p><br><br>
        <h2>Vicente Amigo (1967-)</h2><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_vicente.jpeg" alt="Vicente Amigo"><br><br>
        <p>Vicente Amigo Girol (born in Guadalcanal, Seville province, in 1967) and raised in Córdoba is one of the most important Spanish flamenco guitarists today. He started in flamenco working with artists such as Juan Muñoz (El Tomate), Merengue de Córdoba and Manolo Sanlúcar.</p><br><br><br>
        <p>In flamenco dancing we have the dancers:</p><br><br><br>
        <h2>Carmem Amaya (1918-1963)</h2><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_carmen.jfif" alt="Carmem Amaya"><br><br>
        <p>Carmen would have been born in 1918 in Barcelona, although it is difficult to be sure. The current proposal stems from some recent studies that stipulate 1918 as the year of birth, thanks to the discovery of the 1930 Barcelona Civil Registry document where it can be seen that Carmen Amaya was 12 years old in 1930.<br><br> She was the daughter of a flamenco guitarist, José Amaya and started dancing at a very young age on the beach of Somorrostro in Barcelona (now missing). As a young girl, she attracted attention when she performed in a flamenco group at the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition.</p><br><br><br>
        <h2>Eva Yerbabuena (1970-)</h2><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_eva.jpg" alt="Eva Yerbabuena"><br><br>
        <p>Eva Yerbabuena, born Eva María Garrido (Frankfurt, 1970) is a German-born Spanish dancer. She is considered a great flamenco dancer of our time, winning many awards, including the Premio Nacional de Danza in 2001 in Spain.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Bolero</h1><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_bolero.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
        <p>The bolero is a rhythm that mixes roots from Spain with local influences from various Hispanic American countries. The dance has undergone modifications, developing around more romantic themes, with a slower cadence. With quick, methodical pauses and more fluid movements, unexpected turns, in a very involving pattern, this is another well-known Spanish dance style.<br><br> Historically, the bolero served as entertainment for those who witnessed the bullfights in Spain. It was also commonly practiced at carnivals in Seville. It was originally 2 women and 1 man doing discreet, slow and elegant movements. Extremely relevant to the general history of dance, the bolero is considered to be the forerunner of ballroom dancing.</p><br><br>

        <h1>Fandango, Spanish dance popular in Brazil</h1><br><br>
        <p>Created in the Baroque period, the fandango is one of the most popular Spanish dances. Its elaborate and extremely fast movements, mixing small jumps and tap dances, are the main characteristic of this couples' dance.<br><br> Brought by European immigrants, it is a well-known dance here in Brazil. The Brazilian fandango incorporated minor adaptations, and became very popular in the southern region of the country. Have you ever seen a presentation of the gaucho fandango? Just like in Spain, the dancers here wear traditional and elegant clothes: the women wear long, rounded skirts, while the men wear gaucho pants. </p><br><br>

        <h1>The necessary clothing and accessories</h1><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/dt_vestimenta.jpg"><br><br>
        <p>In the beginning, the clothes worn by the dancers were as simple as peasant women's clothing. They also wore jewelry and adorned their hair with flowers. <br><br> As time went by, the costumes were transformed, and nowadays one of the main characteristics are the elegant round dresses with vibrant and cheerful colors, being the color red very present. Today, women wear dresses with many frills, fans, shawls, typical head accessories, and elaborate makeup.</p><br><br><br><br>
