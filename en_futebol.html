        <h3 class="titulo" id="yellow"> The history of Spanish football </h3><br><br><br>
        <p>Emergence of Spanish Football and its historical context
            Football is a sport that emerged and grew as we know it today in England in the mid-19th century (there are other sports practiced elsewhere in the world, such as the "pok ta pok" that dates back 3 thousand years among the Mayan people, but that only resemble in some way what we know today as football.)
            <br><br>In the mid-19th century Europe was going through a period of economic development thanks to the Industrial Revolution, and in this scenario England emerged as an industrial and economic power in the creation of new international markets. In other words, the English, who had created soccer, were in several countries around the world by the end of the century. This created a special condition where European cities in rapid development maintained contact with English culture, and with soccer, mainly in 3 ways: when English people migrated to European cities and played soccer among themselves; when people in European cities maintained contact with English people and this led to the adoption of innovations such as soccer; and finally, when local people watched English people playing soccer and decided to imitate them.<br><br>There was not one specific way of implementing soccer, but rather an amalgamation of these 3 modes. In a way, this made the process of the emergence of Spanish Football something quite organic. At the time, there was some resistance to the point that some wrote articles in newspapers criticizing the sport for "not being adequate to the Spanish way of living in society", assuming that the game would be a failure in Spain because it was so different from the true Spanish tradition, the bullfights</p><br><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/fcp_fut.jpg" ><br><br><br>
        <p> With the advancing investment of the English, Spain met some good conditions for English investments and this was the springboard for the emergence of Spanish Football. Especially in the then province of Huelva in 1889, the officials of the Rio Tinto Mining Company (who had played since 1878) created Spain's first football club, the Huelva Recreation Club. Huelva, today only disputes the third division of the country. This has a strong relationship with the geography of Spain. Cities were well spread and the process of industrialisation did not go hand in hand with the rest of Europe. </p><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3 class="titulo" id="yellow"> World Cup 2010 </h3><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/fcp_copa.png"><br><br>
        <p>The 2010 FIFA World Cup was held in South Africa. At the end of the 20th century, FIFA already hinted at a possible revival between the continents (not just Europe and America) that would receive the next World Cup editions. As it turned out, the 2006 World Cup would be contested in Africa, which had as its strongest candidate South Africa. However, in 2000, the entity announced Germany as its seat in 2006.<br><br> To minimize the complaints, Joseph Blatter, president of FIFA, assured that the next edition would be on the African continent. Promise made in 2004. South Africa would compete with Morocco, Egypt and Libya, but would win the right to receive the 2010 World Cup. Despite the fear of holding the tournament in a country with alarming inequality and violence and infrastructure below other nations, events during the World Cup were rare.<br><br>Generally, the countries that organize the Cup select 12 host cities to host the games. Because South Africa was not an economic power, FIFA allowed only nine cities to be selected, and Johannesburg had two stadiums. The other eight were Cape Town, Durban, Nelspruit, Polokwane, Rustenburg, Pretoria, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth.</p><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/fcp_estadio.jpg" alt="estadio"><br><br>
        <p>The main stadium of the 2010 World Cup was Soccer City, which is located in Johannesburg. Historically, the location of Soccer City is very important. It was at the old stadium that, in 1990, Nelson Mandela gave his first speech after leaving prison.  The other Johannesburg stadium, Ellis Park, belongs to a rugby team. In 1995, Ellis Park received the final of the World Rugby League, the main sport of the country, won by South Africa itself and portrayed through the film Invictus, in 2009.  This event was very important for racial integration, as it attracted black fans to a considered sport of whites. <br><br> The mascot chosen for the 2010 Cup was the Zakumi leopard. The name comes from a junction of Zouth Africa and kumi, meaning "ten." </p>
