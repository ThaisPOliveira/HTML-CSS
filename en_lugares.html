        <h2>1.	SACRED FAMILY, BARCELONA</h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_SAGRADA_FAMÍLIA.jpg" alt="imagem sagrada famalia"><br><br>
        <p>Construction began in 1882 in a neo-Gothic style. A year later, the project was placed in the hands of Gaudí, who carried out a complete redesign. Gaudí designed an exceptional and innovative temple that would initially be made up of 18 towers, but he only had time to create one of them before his death. <br><br>  When you're done, you'll have a total of 18 upper towers: twelve for the apostles, four for the evangelists, one for the Virgin and the last one for Jesus. In total, the temple will have a height of 172.5 meters.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>2.	ALHAMBRA, GRANADA</h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_ALHAMBRA.jpg" alt="imagem de alhambra"><br><br>
        <p>Its construction dates back to the 13th century and is made up of a palace with a five-arched portico, the Ladies Tower and a large open-air lake. It is also possible to see some small Arab houses that were built years later.<br><br>The palace's enclosure is formed by rectangular courtyards of great beauty and numerous fountains, in addition to the Nasrid buildings that served as housing for the kings and their servants. The oldest building is the Alcazaba.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>3.	CORDOBA MOSQUE</h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_CORDOBA.jpg" alt="imagem de mesquita de Córdoba"><br><br>
        <p>The Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba is a key temple in the entire Islamic West and the most visited monument in the city. With more than thirteen centuries of history, this building served as a place of worship for Visigoths, Muslims and Christians, and today it is an essential monument for understanding the history of Cordoba.<br><br>This sanctuary is formed by several naves composed of columns and two-coloured horseshoe arches.  In total, the prayer room is divided into five different parts according to the materials used in each expansion of the mosque.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>4.	BEACHES OF COSTA DO SOL, MALAGA </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_costadosol.jpg" alt="imagem de Praias da costa do Sol"><br><br>
        <p>Because it is the sunniest place in Europe and has miles of white sand beaches bathed by calm seas, it is no wonder that the beaches of the Costa del Sol are the official retreat of northern Europeans.  So much so that a large part of the population of Malaga and region is made up of English, French and Germans.<br><br>In addition to its 16 sunny beaches, this Andalusian city on the Mediterranean Sea has a highly interesting cultural life.  That’s because the place where the genius Pablo Picasso was born has reinvented itself in recent years and opened museums for all tastes.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>5.	SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA CATHEDRAL </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_catedralsantiago.jpg" alt="imagem de Catedral de Santiago"><br><br>
        <p>The construction of the cathedral began in the year 1075, under the reign of Alfonso VI and promoted by Bishop Diego Peláez.  The works were carried out under the direction of Master Esteban on the remains of ancient temples erected in devotion to the saint.  It was built with three naves and a Latin cross plan, covering na area of approximately 8,300 square meters.<br><br>The Romanesque cathedral with a Latin cross plan was built in granite blocks, covered with slabs of the same material.  The church is organized in a main nave and the transept with three naves, ambulatory at the transept, in addition to the entire perimeter being covered by a tribune.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>6.	AQUEDUCT OF SEGOVIA </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_aqueduto.jpg" alt="imagem de aqueduto de Segóvia"><br><br>
        <p>The Roman aqueduct of Segovia was built by the Romans and preserved in perfect condition.  Its construction dates back to the 2nd century AD, during the reign of Emperor Trajan.  Its function was to transport water from the source of the Fuenfría to the city. <br><br> Its 20,400 stone blocks are not joined by any type of mortar or cement, and are maintained in a perfect and solid balance of forces.  The maximum height of the construction is reached in Praça do Azoguejo, with 28.10 m high and a total of 167 arches.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>7.	PLAZA DE ESPAÑA, SEVILHA </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_plaza.jpg" alt="imagem de Plaza da Espanha"><br><br>
        <p>Built for the 1929 Ibero-American Exhibition, Seville’s Plaza de España is a monumental and majestic space that is one of the main symbols of identity not only for the Spanish capital, but also for the whole of Spain. <br><br> Its plan is semicircular.  It is dominated by 2 towers, one on each side of the enclosure, which frame the central building, where the dependencies are located.  Between the two towers runs a network of galleries with rounded arcades, which open to different parts of the square, where a fountain stands.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2> 8.	REAL ALCÁZAR, SEVILHA </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_alcazar.jpg" alt="imagem de real alcázar"><br><br>
        <p>The Real Alcázar of Seville is a set of palaces surrounded by a wall.  Pedro I “the Cruel” rebuilt the old Almohad building to make it a royal residence in the 14th century.  It has contributions from all eras, although Mudejar and Renaissance styles predominate. <br><br> Today, it is the residence of the Spanish royal family during their stays in the Andalusian capital, but its rooms and gardens are dedicated throughout the year to host exhibitions and cultural events.  The Alcázar of Seville has also been named a UNESCO world heritage site. </p><br><br><br>

        <h2>9.	THE MEDIEVAL CITY OF CUENCA </h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_medieval.jpg" alt="imagem da cidade medieval de Cuenca"><br><br>
        <p>Located between Madrid and Valencia, in the heart of the province of Castilla La Mancha, Cuenca is a wonderful example of a medieval city.  Built on the steep slopes of a mountain, its houses look like they are about to tumble down a gorge.<br><br> It is worth going up the hills and alleys that enter this city -situated between the gorges of the Júcar and Huécar rivers- to let yourself be surprised by its viewpoints.  Among the essential stops is the Plaza Mayor, where you will see the arches of the City Hall and the beautiful Cathedral, which began to be built at the end of the 12th century.</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>10.	CASA BATLLÓ, BARCELONA</h2><br><br>
        <img src="imagens/trm_castelobatllo.jpg" alt="imagem de "><br><br>
        <p> The building, built in 1877 by Emilio Sala Cortés, was remodeled between 1904 and 1906 by the Catalan architect during his naturalist period, something that can be seen in its facade.  This UNESCO world heritage site is currently owned by the Bernat family, but it was opened to the public in 1995. <br><br> The inner courtyard is covered by ceramic pieces designed by Gaudí, starting in dark blue at the top, going down to lighter shades of blue until reaching the end, where they are white.  On the top floor there is na attic with na organic structure made up of the typical catenary arches by Gaudí.  On the terrace can be seen the loin of the dragon crossed by a four-armed marble cross, and four sets of chimneys.</p><br><br><br>
